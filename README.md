# Syntax Highlighting Tool

This is a simple syntax highlighting tool written in Python. The tool consists of two main functions: scanner and apply_coloring. The scanner function tokenizes a given expression, while the apply_coloring function reads a file containing code, applies syntax highlighting based on the tokens identified by the scanner, and generates an HTML file with colored syntax.
